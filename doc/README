            Yong 
Yet anOther Network monitorinG

Yong is kind of system monitoring / remote administration application which help
if you have lots of remote server to take care of , it can inform you if remote
server or service goes down , the hotplugable prober allows you to set custom 
protocol based "send message" , "expect message" test to make sure remote 
service is running OK .

for example when you ask remote web server for "GET /" , you expect the answer
to contain some html codes , like <HEAD> , heres how you can do it using yong 
main configuration file , yong.conf which can be found in /etc/yong.conf 

remote {
# server name , have to be resolved into currect ip
servername=www.remote.com
# aks dns server of target for itself , make sure its alive
udp_dns_server_check=1
# aks ntp time server for time , make sure its alive
udp_ntp_server_check=1
# simple icmp echo request
icmp_echo_check=1
#
# HotPlugable Probing
# <protocol name>:<target tcp port>:"message to send":"answer to expect":<timeout>
#
# <protocol name>: this can be anything , its interval
# <target tcp port>: target tcp port of protocol , 80 for web
# "message to send": message to send for server , "GET /" for web
# "message to expect": message expected to receive , "<HEAD>" for web
# <timeout>: timeout for given session .
#
#
http:80:"GET":"HEAD":2
}
